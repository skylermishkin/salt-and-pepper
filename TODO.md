- erase Beacon.js.  A beacon is just a `{position, color}` hash
- dry up standard get set setup. `addProp(this, 'color', validator)`
- use promises instead of callbacks


- idea: instead of having phases, let all be continuous. pepper's movement is also continuous, but faster that salt.  when you click, you set where pepper is headed.
- another idea: as salt collects dust, salt becomes more massive.
